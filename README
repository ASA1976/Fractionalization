                                Fractionalization


This example is a demonstration of the relational association programming
paradigm model.  The same example is demonstrated in the C, C++, Visual Basic, 
Python and Tcl programming languages, demonstrating their capacity to achieve
the paradigm model.

Only natural integer fractions are supported as this is intended as a simple
demonstrative example and not a library for general use.
