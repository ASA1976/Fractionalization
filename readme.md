# Relational Association Programming

## Fractionalization Example

This small project aims to demonstrate all ten of the [Relational Association
Paradigm](http://github.com/ASA1976/RAP) programmatic elements in a single 
example which is implemented in several programming languages.  There are also 
files named proof(...) in the C and C++ programming language directories which 
can be used to compare C and C++14 instructional efficiency as well as 
determining if C++ compiler template implementations are clean 
(without undue memory or processor overhead).
